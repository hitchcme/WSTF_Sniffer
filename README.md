*********BASIC DEVELOPING INSTRUCTIONS************\n
1) You need to have a GIT BASH shell installed or some other thing maybe Hitch can expand on/n
2) in order to access the robot while you are here you need an ssh tool installed, simply entering 'ssh' and executing should be/n 
   enough to check, also check for nano text editor again 'nano' then the file name you want to open will confirm this/n
3) Now 'cd' into the desired directory if you do not know the subfolder name use 'ls' (visible files) or 'ls -a' (all files),/n 
   which for us is ../Google Drive/...../Source/WSTF_Sniffer_Git/../n
4) Now you are in the directory that has your file you can now edit, compile, and run git commands/n
     /ta) to edit 'nano filename' different commands within the text editor are shown at the bottom/n
     /tb) to compile your code simply hit 'make filename' or simply 'make', it is also good practice to enter 'make clean' before/n 
        each compile. 
     /tc) Now that your code is error free and ready to share, to commit it to Git: 'git commit' look to see if the file you desire to commit is "staged for commit"/n
            if not, try 'git add' then 'git commit' again. Now write something then [ctrl][x] to save, now enter 'git push'./n
To ensure you have the most recent changes 'git fetch' then 'git pull' should update your current directories -so- not a good/n 
idea in the middle of editing a file, you will most likely lose it.
